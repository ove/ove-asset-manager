# GigaImage Worker

This worker uses the [pyvips](https://libvips.github.io/pyvips/) library (which provides Python bindings for
[libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/)) to create a [Deep Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom) image that can be displayed using the
[OVE Images App](https://ove.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ove-apps/packages/ove-app-images/README.html).

Currently no runtime options are available for this worker.
